# David-Jones-RDD-Replication
Using Maimonides' rule to estimate the effect of class size on student achievement:
This is a study that uses Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to try and establish a causal relationship between decreased class size and increased student achievement. This study uses classroom data from Isreali Fourth and Fifth grade classrooms, which I have added as .dta files in this respository. These .dta files were read into Python using the pandas read_stata() function. Along with these .dta files, I have attached a .ipynb file that was converted to .html with the code I wrote. Finally, a Latex presentation was put together and added to this repository along with an empricial exercise related to the study.
